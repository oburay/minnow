My name: OBU RAYMOND BUERNOR

My SUNet ID: OBURAY

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to credit/thank the course assistant Ashish Rao for his assistance in resolving some errors I encountered.

This lab took me about 8 hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was:  507477

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: Its simple to send a mail using the SMTP service however I'm wondering why the service does not verify the sender's identity before the mail is sent. I look forward to learning more about how mail client applications are developed based on this abstraction. 

Describe ByteStream implementation. [Describe data structures and
approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered or tested.
Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared with
alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of
bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]
